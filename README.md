# Hand_Gesture_Recognition_Project-with-OpenCV
Hand Gesture Recognition Project with OpenCV, Mediapipe, Arduino, and Pyfirmata
ðŸŒŸ Excited to share my latest project: Finger Detection System! Leveraging OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries in Python, I developed a real-time hand detection system that accurately identifies finger positions. Connects Python (PyCharm) to Arduino (Arduino IDE) using pyFirmata library for communication.

The system not only detects hand gestures but also calculates the distance between finger joints to determine finger positions (up or down). Additionally, I designed a circuit with five LEDs connected to Arduino output pins, representing each finger. When a finger is raised, the corresponding LED lights up, enabling advanced pattern creation and device control.
